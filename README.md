# Task-4.1-Askerov-Rustam-
All explanations inside the files.

I have Main directory /src

Directory for html templates /templates

I have dorectory rouse with all python scripts

Inside the /Routes scripts contained in their own directories

!!!!Attention!!!!: for interacting with API you just need to go to "/" endpoint and you will get HTML page with buttons that linked to task endpoints. 

              P.s. Python script with description in it`s own /info directory in /Routes
